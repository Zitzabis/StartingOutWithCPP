# Starting Out With C++
Solutions to the Programming Challenges found in "Starting Out With C++" by Tony Gaddis (8th Edition).


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide solutions for the Programming Challenges found in "Starting Out With C++" by Tony Gaddis (8th Edition).

This project began both as a desire on my part to reread the book, strengthen my C++ and give guidance to other programers that may be starting down the path of programming. I used this book when first learning C++ at Southern Wesleyan University under Dr. P. Jordan. The man taught me a lot of things but I may have still gotten things wrong. If so, feel free to make a branch, add your contribution and request a merge.

## Homework Rules
The answers found in this project should never be turned in for a grade. I can not verify if they comply with what your teacher requires or if they comply with modern day standards. I am constantly tweaking the code and making sure it works in the best way possible. It would be unwise to copy, paste and submit without first reviewing it.


Use these as a reference if you are stuck or you would like to see what the completed result should look like.
